# Portfolio
I decided to create a chic modern portfolio website to show viewers my personal sense of style and versatility. The color choices I used where mainly black, gray, and white, I was going for something simple but appealing. I used the mail icon and LinkedIn icon I believe, these were provided by squarespace.I didn't have many images on my site other than a photo of myself and 2 samples of work. After peer review I added in the samples of work because initially I was not going to because as a newUX major I felt unexperienced. Navigating my site is fairly easy which is what I was going for to keep people on the site. I had trouble with CSS and a little bit with JS with editing and knowing certain tags, but learning along the way. I found navigating and understanding GitHub very confusing during this process so there may be errors in my files.
